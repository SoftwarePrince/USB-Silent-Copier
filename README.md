# USB-Silent-Copier
USB Silent Copier is a Windows application which copies USB Data Silentely.

This Application has AntiVirus like GUI so that it can tell you how much data from USB has been copied.

## Install:
Open `USB Silent Copier.exe` and if it is already not istalled it will be installed else it will not.

## To Change Destination Path:
Change the Path where you want it to copy data in `C:\Users\UserName\Documents\USB Data 3.0.0.txt`
If you Dont change path and you dont Have space in C drive it will be failed to copy.

## Description:

USB Silent Copier copies all the content of all the USB.
Backup all your USB drives without clicking ANY button! Just plug in your USB drive and you're done. Collect data from USB drives that people connect to your computer. Analyze it later, find out who are you getting viruses from. It runs automatically on Windows startup and detects USB drives instantly upon insertion.

Time after time we improved it, and it doesn’t copy just documents but also pictures, audio/video, other stuff or all the content of all usb. It can copy all the flash drives that are connected to the pc that we installed it. It also can copy all external hard-drives. You can select which usb you wanna ignore. Obviously you don’t wanna copy your own usb. Choose the drive in which you wanna save the copied contents -should have at least 30GB of free space. 

We have no competition, it is a unique software.

We don’t know of any other software that does this specifically or as better, but we think there are a few hardware devices which cost thousands of $$.

## UnInstall:
In Windows 10 goto Task Manager, open startup tab and Disable USB Copyer from there.
or In all Windows press `Windows+R` to open Run Box. then Type `"%AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup"`  and press enter. a folder will be opened and delete USB copyer.exe from there.
and then restart your Computer or else goto Task Manager and Close USB copyer.exe
